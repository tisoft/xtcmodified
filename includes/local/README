This directory contains local configuration information.

You find a file named configure.org inside this directory.
If you rename this file to configure.php it is identically the file 
you build, while running the installation Program.

Use configure.org as a backup of your configuration data.

In case you rename configure.org into configure.php and hold it inside of the includes/local/
directory, it can be used to override
the defaults set in includes/configure.php and includes/application_top.php

Remember to execute PHP commands the file needs to start with <?php and end with ?>
